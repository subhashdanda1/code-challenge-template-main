Problem 4 - REST API
--------------------
Choose a web framework (e.g. Flask, Django REST Framework). Create a REST API with the following GET endpoints:

/api/weather
/api/yield
/api/weather/stats

Each endpoint should return a JSON-formatted response with a representation of the ingested data in your database. Allow clients to filter the response by date and station ID (where present) using the query string. Data should be paginated.

Your answer should include all files necessary to run your API locally, along with any unit tests.
